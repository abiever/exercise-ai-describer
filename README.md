# AI Exercise How-To Creator

Utilizing the power of OpenAI's ChatGPT model, this "Exercise How-To Creator" takes information such as the desired exercise's name and specific keywords to produce relevant written content that can be used for description boxes on social media sites like YouTube. 

## About

As a former professional of the fitness industry, one of the tasks that was often necessary while creating educational video content online was completing the description boxes with content that was both pertinent to the exercise being demonstrated, yet also SEO friendly at the same time. This was a generally time-consuming and tedious endeavor that no one particular enjoyed, but it helped bring in clients, so it needed to be done. 

If this tool had existed at that time, many hours could have been saved. Now that it does, up-and-coming trainers creating their own video libraries can easily fill out their descriptions in a fraction of the time.
